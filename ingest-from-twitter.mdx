### Set up Twitter ingestion

Go to the {settings/integrations} page and select the Twitter integration. You can search for any Twitter handles you want to monitor for mentions. Then, select and add them. All the mentioned tweets will be automatically imported into Monterey. Those tweets will be categorized in your Monterey All Feedback tab. 

Anyone who has access to your Monterey workspace can set up Twitter integration. 

### Use advanced query

Want to have advanced control on the tweets ingestion? We support advanced query. You can use the Twitter docs or API explorer to build your query string [here](../https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query).
