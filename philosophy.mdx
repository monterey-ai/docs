In today's tech landscape, while platforms like Mixpanel and Amplitude have democratized product analytics, the potential of qualitative data remains untapped. Enter Reforge Insights (formerly Monterey AI) â€” designed to unearth these hidden insights and make feedback collection a seamless experience for product builders.

### Choose a scalable feedback system from the start

Every product builder feels the inconvenience of juggling various platforms for feedback. Reforge Insights aims to automate this. We offer a comprehensive suite to capture and collate feedback, eliminating the need for endless switches between tools. Growing businesses often change tools, leading to increased costs, user confusion, and data loss. With Reforge Insights, you can customize your feedback gathering from the outset, adapting features as you grow.

### Begin with broad insights; dive deeper when necessary

Start your journey by observing overarching patterns and trends in the feedback. This bird's eye view allows for an understanding of general sentiment and recurring themes. However, when nuances matter, Reforge Insights enables you to delve into the intricacies, ensuring that every valuable insight is within reach.

### A comprehensive repository for qualitative feedback

While quantitative data has its champions, qualitative feedback has long been underrepresented. Reforge Insights bridges this gap, creating a singular hub for all qualitative insights. From appreciations to bug reports, every piece of feedback is stored, categorized, and made ready for analysis.
