## Snippets and feedback

**Turn customer feedback into actionable insights**

Feedback is the foundation of Insight Analytics—and [snippets](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/snippets) are how we make sense of it. A _snippet_ is a concise, categorized highlight that captures the core insight from a piece of raw feedback. These are curated by our AI model to surface what's most relevant, while preserving access to the full original message when needed.

Snippets help you move from scattered input to structured insight, so your team can prioritize with confidence.

### How snippets work

Each snippet shown in the product has been analyzed and generated by our AI model to ensure clarity and relevance. These snippets are connected to their original feedback source, so you can always dig deeper for more context.

### Understanding feedback structure

[**Feedback**](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/snippets/feedback) is the core unit in Insight Analytics. Each item has a unique ID and supports detailed fields and metadata to help you organize, track, and analyze responses at scale.

Here’s how feedback is structured:

### Description

The core content of the feedback—this is where we identify user intent and key themes.

### Title (optional)

Displayed only when feedback is submitted through the public voting portal.

### Customer

Each feedback item is tied to a single customer (e.g., a user, account, or individual submitter), called Contacts in our system. Customer profiles can be enriched with metadata from connected tools so you can understand who they are and what feedback they’ve submitted.

## Categorization & organization

### Auto categorization

Feedback is automatically sorted into four default categories:

- Complaint
- Kudos
- Request
- Help

You can change the category anytime in the Feedback detail view. Need additional categories? Contact us at [hello@reforge.com](mailto:hello@reforge.com) to upgrade your plan.

### Tags

Use tags to apply more granular labels related to your projects, features, or teams. They can also be helpful to add labels to more specific internal language or terms that might be more difficult to categorize. [Learn more about Tags here](/tags)

<Tip>
  Tip: Avoid over-tagging. Use tags only when other built-in fields don’t capture the nuance you need.

## Metadata & properties

Every piece of feedback includes basic metadata to help with sorting and filtering:

- **General properties**: Source, content, customer ID, and created time
- **Metadata**: System-generated fields from integrations or user-defined schemas
