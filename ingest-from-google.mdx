## Set up

You can find the option to integrate Google Play Reviews in the [integration settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/). Open Google Play Reviews, then search for any app whose reviews you want to monitor. Select the app to add it. You can also add multiple apps.
Anyone who has access to your Monterey workspace can set up Google Play Reviews integration. 


## Auto ingest feedback from App store

All reviews of the app will be auto-ingested into Monterey. The feedback will be auto-categorized. New reviews are fetched daily. You can also go to [Google play reviews setting page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/google-play-reviews) to trigger the fetch manually.
