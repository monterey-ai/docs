Reforge Insights makes the collection, triage, and analysis of qualitative data super easy, so you can focus on building better product with faster insights.

Let’s get started and make waves!

## Setup Workspace

The fastest way to set up your workspace is through [https://insights.reforge.com/.](https://insights.reforge.com/.) You can start a free trial on the starter plan, or ping [chun.jiang@reforge.com](mailto:chun.jiang@reforge.com) to kickstart a growth tier free trial.
Once you've set up your workspace, navigate to your Settings page (gear icon, bottom left), then the Members tab to invite your teammates by email or invite link.

If you have multiple workspaces, go the top left to switch between multiple workspaces.

## Connect Data Sources

Next, you can import data via CSV, native integrations, Zapier, or API. Check out our overview on aggregating and collecting data [here](https://docs.monterey.ai/overview).

## Create Themes Report

To create your first report, go to Themes page and click Run Report. If there are enough data in the report to produce themes, you can see them under each category. You can also choose to create a report with filtered snippets.

## Ask Monty

Ask Monty is a key part of understanding and interacting with your data. We provide the following functions along with chat: search, share, and save. You can use Ask Monty to ask reasoning questions like "Why do users churn?" or dive into details like "Help me find the top pain points on user experience from data in Q2 2023".

You can use these results to make data-driven decisions about how to improve your customer and product experience with your team.
