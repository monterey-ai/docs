### **Steps to Set Up an Alert**

- **Keyword/Description**: Define the essence of feedback you're targeting. For example, you might set it to "complaints on user experience of subscriptions".
- **Volume Threshold**: Determine how many instances of feedback (snippets) must occur before triggering an alert.
- **Time Window**: Set the frequency at which you want to assess the volume threshold, such as "per day".
- **Recipient Emails**: Specify the email addresses that should receive these notifications. You can list multiple emails, one per line.
- **Activate**: Once all parameters are set, create your alert.
