## Set up

You can find Discord integration on the [integration settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/). Follow the instructions to connect your Discord account. You can connect multiple channels from one Discord account to Monterey. 
Only admins of your Monterey workspace can set up Discord integration. 


## Auto-ingested messages to feedbacks

Monterey will automatically retrieve messages from Discord channels on a daily basis, or you can manually fetch them anytime in the [Discord settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/discord). 
If there is too much noise in your Discord channels, don't worry; our built-in auto-ingest feature will filter out spam messages from the message history for you.
