Only admins of your Monterey workspace can set up Discord integration. 


## Auto-ingested messages to feedbacks

Monterey will automatically retrieve messages from Discord channels on a daily basis, or you can manually fetch them anytime in the [Discord settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/cl5b6pdc45011ebfde64e4qkf/settings/integrations/discord). If there is too much noise in your Discord channels, don't worry, our built-in auto-ingest feature will filter out spam messages from the message history for you.
