## Set up Public voting board

Go to [Public voting board page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/cl5b6pdc45011ebfde64e4qkf/settings/voting-board) in setting. Follow the guide to create your customized voting board with your domain name, company name, colors, and logos. Once you click "Create", a new section called "Enable public voting board" will appear and be enabled. Under this section, there will be a button labeled "Go to voting board". Clicking on this button will take you to your public voting board. This is a page that you can share with your users.


## Roadmap

Once a public voting board is created, a Roadmap view is automatically generated which allows users to track the progress of the public projects from the voting board. You can choose to enable or disable it at any time according to your needs.
