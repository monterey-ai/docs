## Feedback Board

To utilize the feedback board to provide your users with a way to provide feedback to you, go back to the navigation menu and choose "Feedback board" in the _Workflows_ section.

Simply toggle "Enable Public Voting Board," and then you can utilize your portal link to share with customers or link to from your own sites and apps.

When users log into your public portal, they can view, vote, and comment on feedback and requests. Each submitted feedback will be auto categorized as `request, issues, question, appreciation`, and will be ready to get analyzed in your dashboard, along with other data sources.

Comments on Portal Feedback

After users have submitted feedback to the Feedback board or on a Roadmap item, comments may be made on that feedback, both by public users, as well as users internal to your team.

Comments made to the Reforge Insight Analytics internal app view will be private by default, and not displayed publicly. They can be optionally made public, if desired to reply to the external users.

When viewed in the internal view of Reforge Insight Analytics, that your team has access to, you can see both public and private comments.

**Enable Feedback Tracking**

![CleanShot 2025-04-03 at 10.52.41.png](/CleanShot2025-04-03at10.52.41.png)

Feedback Tracking will allow your users to view feedback submitted to your workspace **from any source by them and from users in the same organization.**

This can be useful if you wish to allow users from a given company to understand what has already been asked or requested by them and their teammates. **Only users who have signed in with a work email will be able to access the additional views here.** For example, users with "@gmail.com" will not have access, but users with "@company-name.com" will.

Note that these views will show the feedback content (title & description), who posted the feedback, and when. They will also be able to comment on this feedback.

## Roadmap

![CleanShot 2025-04-03 at 11.18.28.png](/CleanShot2025-04-03at11.18.28.png)

To utilize the roadmap, go back to the navigation menu and choose "Roadmap" in the _Portal_ section.

The roadmap allows you to share projects and their status with your customers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the toggle at the top of the page">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your first Roadmap item - Click '+ New Item'">
    This can be as granular as you'd like. We often see customers use it at a
    "project" or "feature" level, such that the items are meaningful to users,
    and there aren't so many that it becomes overwhelming.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the item details">
    You can configure the title, description, status, labels, and author, as
    well as a cover image\!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish or save a Draft">
    By default, the save button at the bottom right will save as a 'draft', meaning it is only visible internally and not to your users on the public portal Roadmap view. If you are ready to publish it to the public, then you can click the arrow on the button and switch to 'publish' mode. Don't worry, you can delete the item or convert it back to a draft later\!
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Commenting**\
When portal users comment on a roadmap item, that comment will become a Feedback record inside of Reforge Insight Analytics and become visible on the public portal feedback list.
