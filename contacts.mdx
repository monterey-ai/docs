## Usage

Reforge Insight Analytics will group all users who provided feedback in [Contacts](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/feedback/contacts). You can find the user's name, email, user ID, and all of their feedback in one place. To locate a specific customer, you can use the search filter by name.

## Cohorts

You can create customized customer [cohorts](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/feedback/contacts) and assign attributes to them in order to better organize your customers. Analyze feedback by cohorts, or send surveys to a targeted audience.
