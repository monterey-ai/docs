Montereyâ€™s structured report categorizes and groups feedback into similar types and themes. The report is updated automatically with new data weekly.

### Snapshot of Feedback Categories

At a glance, view the total count of snippets received and delve deeper into the segmented numbers for feature requests, bug reports, questions, and appreciations. This offers a quick understanding of the kind of feedback coming your way.

### Top Themes Bar Chart

Visualize the pulse of your user feedback with a bar chart highlighting the top 5 prevalent themes. This graphical representation allows you to quickly discern which topics are most resonating with your user base.

### Detailed Theme Summaries

- **Theme Overviews**: For each identified theme, see a brief summary, the number of snippets associated with it, and the theme's percentage of the current category's total snippets.
- **Interactivity**: Expand any theme to view the specific snippets that fall under it. This provides context and depth to each identified trend.
- **Customizability**: Tailor the data to your needs! Edit the theme titles for pinpoint accuracy, delete irrelevant themes, or save crucial ones for easier future access.

### Filter

- **Source**: Understand feedback trends from specific channels or platforms.
- **Time**: Narrow down themes based on specific time frames, such as monthly or quarterly trends, to understand the evolving nature of user feedback.
