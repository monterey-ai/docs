## Set up

You can find the option to integrate App Store Reviews in the [integration settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/). Open App Store Reviews, then search for any app whose reviews you want to monitor. Select the app to add it. You can also add multiple apps.
Anyone who has access to your Monterey workspace can set up App Store Reviews integration. 


## Auto ingest feedback from App store

After set up is completed, all app reviews will be auto-ingested into Monterey. The feedback will be auto-categorized. New reviews are fetched daily. You can also go to [App store review settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/app-store-reviews) to trigger the fetch manually.
