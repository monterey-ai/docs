## Set up

You can find the option to integrate Apple Store Reviews in the [Intigration setting page](../https://app.monterey.ai/w/cl5b6pdc45011ebfde64e4qkf/settings/integrations/). Open Apple Store Reviews, then search for any app whose reviews you want to monitor. Select the app to add it, and you can add multiple apps.
Anyone who has access to your Monterey workspace can set up Apple Store Reviews integration. 


## Auto ingest feedback from App store

After set up is completed, all reviews of the app will be auto-ingested into Monterey. The feedback will be auto-catagorised. New reviews are fetched daily. You can also go to [App store review setting page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/cl5b6pdc45011ebfde64e4qkf/settings/integrations/app-store-reviews) to trigger the fetch manually.
