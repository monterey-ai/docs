Feedback is the unit in our app. Each feedback has an unique ID that we tracked internally and used for join data later.
For each feedback, we provide the following fields:


### Description

Description holds the context of each feedback. This is where we will dive into with our models to identify the intent and context easily.
You can easily fill in, and edit the description with the ui.


### Title (Optional)

Title is only shown if the feedback comes from public voting portal.


### Customer

Each feedback is tied to one customer, which could be your user, customer, or simply any person entity that raises feedback.
Customer is also an important entity here - we will enhance each customer unit with the metadata that pulled from analytics / data tools to polish the profile of customer, so you know who the customer is, and what feedback they have raised.


### Category

Monterey automatically sorts feedback into bug, feature, question, and appreciation categories. If you think a different category is more appropriate for a particular piece of feedback, you can change it by clicking "Category" in the Feedback detail view. 

If you need additional custom categories, please contact us at support@monterey.ai to upgrade.


### Project areas

Organize feedback into project areas based on larger initiatives or teams. You can customize these project areas in the [project areas page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/cl5b6pdc45011ebfde64e4qkf/settings/project-areas). When you create a ticket from [?to be add?] and Intercom, you will be asked to select product areas. You can also edit this information at anytime in the Feedback detail view.


### Tags

Tags give you an extra level of categorization. Be careful when creating new tags. Feedback columns such as categories, priority, status, source, and project area should cover most of the attributes you care about in feedback. Tags should only be used if you need extra granularity. You can add and edit tags in the settings/tags page.


### Priority

You can assign a priority to a particular piece of feedback. There are three levels of priority you can choose from, high, medium and low. You can set the priority in the feedback detail View or configure it directly in the list of all feedback.


### Progress

Progress can help you keep track of feedback states. You can set up progress manually in feedback detail view or all feedback list. If feedback is submitted from a public feedback portal, the progress of the feedback will also be publicly visible on the Feedback Portal Roadmap view.
