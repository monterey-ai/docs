## Overview
Integration with Gong is a great way to get product insights with and from your Sales team. With the integration, you team can:
- Surface the trend in customer calls
- Extract commonly asked feature requests, bug reports, and questions
- Understand what are the commercial risks and opportunities from win - loss notes
- Summarize sales communications to actionable product insights

<Note> If this is just one time ingestion or low volume, we recommend you upload via CSV or Zapier instead of building a continuous pipeline.</Note>

## Authorization & Available Data
Gong calls can be retrieved manually or though OAuth. Based on the customer requests, we can pull the following fields:
- Meta Data (Basic details such as call date, title, call URL, etc)
- Parties (A list of the call's participants)
- Media (The media urls of the call)
- Content (Analysis of the interaction content)
- Interaction (Metrics collected around the interaction during the call)
- Collaboration (Collaboration information added to the call)
- Context (A list of links to external systems such as CRM, Dialer, Case Management, etc)

Other configurations include project based control and PII filtering beforehand. For example, for teams that only want to analyze call transcripts on certain projects, or doesn't want to include private calls, we will help understand the best way to set up the fields.
