# Managing Multiple Domains

You can add multiple domains to your project to make it accessible from different URLs. Here's how to set up a second domain:

1. Navigate to your project's settings
2. Go to the "Domains" section
3. Click "Add Domain"
4. Enter your new domain name
5. Follow the DNS configuration instructions:
   - Add an A record pointing to our IP
   - Add a CNAME record if required
6. Wait for DNS propagation (this can take up to 48 hours)
7. Verify your domain ownership
8. Set your preferred primary domain if desired

## Tips for Managing Multiple Domains
- Make sure each domain has proper SSL certificates
- Consider which domain you want as your primary domain
- You can have multiple domains pointing to the same project
- Each domain will need separate DNS configuration

## Common Issues
- DNS propagation delays
- Incorrect DNS records
- SSL certificate issues
- Domain verification problems
