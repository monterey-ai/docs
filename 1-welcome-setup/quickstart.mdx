### 🚀 Set up your workspace

The fastest way to get started is by [starting a free trial](#) on a **Starter plan**—or reach out to [chun.jiang@reforge.com](mailto:chun.jiang@reforge.com) to kick off a **Growth-tier trial** with expanded features.

Once you're in:

- Head to **Settings → Members**
- Invite teammates by email or with a shareable link

You’ll be collaborating in no time.

### 🔌 Connect your data sources

Bring in feedback from wherever it lives. You can:

- Import CSV files
- Use native integrations (like Zendesk, Slack, or Salesforce)
- Connect through **Zapier** or our **API**

Check out our [Data Aggregation Overview](#) for a full breakdown.

### Explore your feedback

As data flows in, Insight Analytics automatically generates **Snippets**—short, scannable pieces of real customer feedback.

These snippets are grouped into **Themes**, which reveal key trends and patterns based on:

- Volume
- Sentiment
- Shared context

You'll start seeing insights almost instantly.

### Create and share a Report

Dive deeper by turning your Themes into a **Report**:

- Filter by timeframe
- Add charts and visuals
- Highlight Subthemes (automatically suggested when enough data exists)

Want to stay in the loop? Set up **notifications** to track ongoing feedback via **Slack** or **email**.

### Ask Monty (our AI chat)

Monty is your AI sidekick for exploring insights. Ask natural-language questions like:

> “Why are users churning?”\
> “What’s frustrating about onboarding?”\
> “Summarize top UX issues from Q2 2023”

It’s like having an analyst on call—24/7.

### Turn insights into action

Use your findings to guide roadmap decisions, fix pain points, and align your team around what matters most to your users.
