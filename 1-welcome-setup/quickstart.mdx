## Set up your workspace

The fastest way to get started is by [starting a free trial on a starter plan](https://insights.reforge.com/.), or reach out to [chun.jiang@reforge.com](mailto:chun.jiang@reforge.com) to kick off a Growth-tier trial with expanded features. 

Once you're in: 

- Head to [Settings](https://insights.reforge.com/w/clxxig4hx00z41rougnv3jnc2/settings) [**→**](https://insights.reforge.com/w/clxxig4hx00z41rougnv3jnc2/settings/demos) [Members](https://insights.reforge.com/w/clxxig4hx00z41rougnv3jnc2/settings/members) 
- Invite teammates by email or with a sharable link

You’ll be collaborating in no time.

## Connect your data sources

Bring in feedback from wherever it lives. You can:

- Use native integrations (like Zendesk, Slack, or Salesforce)
- Import CSV files 
- Connect through Zapier or our API 

Check out our overview on aggregating and collecting data [here](https://docs.monterey.ai/overview).

## Explore your feedback 

As data flows in, Insight Analytics automatically generates [**Snippets**](https://insights.reforge.com/w/clxxig4hx00z41rougnv3jnc2/snippets), which are short, scannable pieces of real customer feedback.

These snippets are grouped into [**Themes**](https://insights.reforge.com/w/clxxig4hx00z41rougnv3jnc2/feedback/structured/default), which reveal key trends and patterns based on:

- Volume
- Sentiment
- Shared context

You'll start seeing insights almost instantly.

## Create & share a Report

Dive deeper by turning your Themes into a [**Report**](https://insights.reforge.com/w/clxxig4hx00z41rougnv3jnc2/reports), or create one from scratch:

- Filter by timeframe, sentiment, source, and more
- Add charts and visuals
- Explore subthemes (added when enough data exists)

Want to stay in the loop? Set up notifications to track feedback around this topic over time via Slack or Email.

## Ask anything about your data

Monty is your AI sidekick for exploring insights. Ask natural-language questions like:

> "Why are users churning?"\
> "What’s frustrating about onboarding?"\
> "Summarize top UX issues from Q2 2023"

It’s like having an analyst on call, 24/7.

## Turn insights into action

Use your findings to guide roadmap decisions, fix pain points, and align your team around what matters most to your users.
