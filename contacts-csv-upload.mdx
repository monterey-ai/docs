## CSV Format

Your CSV file should contain the following columns:

- `contactName` - The contact's full name
- `contactEmail` - The contact's email address
- `contactAccountName` - The associated account/company name
- `contactAccountDomain` - Associated company's domain (e.g., "example.com")
- `contactSourceId` - External identifier for the contact
- `contractValue` - Associated contract value (numeric)
- **Additional columns** - Any other columns will be stored as metadata

### Example CSV

```csv
contactSourceId,contactName,contactEmail,contactAccountName,contactAccountDomain,contractValue,title,department
CONTACT-001,John Smith,john.smith@acme.com,Acme Corporation,acme.com,100000,VP Sales,Sales
CONTACT-002,Sarah Jones,sarah.j@acme.com,Acme Corporation,acme.com,100000,Director,Sales
CONTACT-003,Mike Johnson,mike@techstart.io,TechStart,techstart.io,25000,Engineer,Engineering
```

## How Contacts Are Matched

### Contact Matching Logic

- **If `contactSourceId` is provided**:
  - Matches against existing contact with the same source ID
- **Otherwise**, attempts to match on:
  - Contact email address
  - Contact name

### Account Association

For each contact:

- Attempts to match existing account by domain
- If no domain match, tries matching by account name
- Creates new account if no matches found and account info provided

## Required Fields

You must provide at least one of:

- `contactEmail`
- `contactSourceId`

Rows missing both fields will be skipped.

## Best Practices

1. **Include source IDs if available for precise matching.**
2. **Provide account domains for accurate account association.**
3. **Use consistent naming for accounts**
4. **Include any additional fields you want to track as metadata columns.**
5. **Review your CSV data before upload to ensure accuracy.**

## What Happens During Import

1. **System validates all rows in your CSV.**
2. For each valid row:
   - Checks for valid contact name or email
   - Attempts to match existing contacts by source ID or email
   - Links or creates associated account by domain/name
   - Updates matched records or creates new ones
   - Preserves existing data while adding new data

## Supported File Types

The account import accepts the `.csv` and `.xlsx` files
