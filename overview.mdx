As product builders, we all have experienced the extreme pain of setting up and switching between different platforms to capture feedback. We want to help you put that on autopilot by providing everything you need to collect and capture feedback. Thus, there are three categories of capture methods that you can find in Monterey:

## Allow users to submit feedback anytime anywhere

- To help startups jumpstart collecting feedback, we provide public feedback portal that audience can vote on.
- If you are looking for in-app feedback collection, check out our in-product feedback widget, that you can install in 5 minutes.

## Actively capture feedback

Collecting at the speed of thought is enabled by our Chrome extension and native intergrations with apps like Slack and Intercom. Simply highlight, click, and then you are ready to go.

## Proactively streamline user feedback

We call it champagne problems when you have thousands of feedback coming in everyday. But don't worry, you are well equipped to put the collecting and organizing in autopilot with us. Check out our integrations with Slack, Discord, Intercom, Zendesk, Twitter, etc.
