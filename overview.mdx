As product builders, we all have experienced the extreme pain of setting up and switching between different platforms to capture feedback.
We want to help you put that on autopilot by providing everything you need to collect and capture feedback.
Thus, there are four categories of capture methods that you can find in Reforge Insight Analytics:

## Connect with the data sources and let feedback flow in

Reforge Insight Analytics connects with a large amount of data sources with out of box [integrations](/integrations). After setting up the integrations, all the unstructured data that contains voices of customers, such as support tickets, sales transcripts, and surveys, will flow into the system in continuous and real-time fashion.

## Capture ad hoc feedback via Slack and Chrome Extention

Collecting at the speed of thought is enabled by our [Chrome extension](/chrome-extension) and native integrations with apps like [Slack](/Integrations/Slack). Simply highlight, click, and you are ready to go.

## Create and upload feedback via interface

You can log into the platform (insights.reforge.com) and upload dataset in [csv](/csv-upload) and text format, or simply click the create button and enter feedback directly via the interface.

## Allow your users to submit feedback anytime anywhere

- To help startups jump-start collecting feedback, we provide a public feedback portal where your audience can vote on issues and requests.
- If you are looking for in-app feedback collection, check out our in-product [feedback widget](/widget) that can be installed in 5 minutes.
