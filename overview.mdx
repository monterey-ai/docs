As product builders, we all have experienced the extreme pain of setting up and switching between different platforms to capture feedback. We want to help you put that on autopilot by providing everything you need to collect and capture feedback. Thus, there are three categories of capture methods that you can find in Monterey:

## Allow users to submit feedback anytime anywhere

- To help startups jump-start collecting feedback, we provide a public feedback portal where your audience can vote on issues and requests.
- If you are looking for in-app feedback collection, check out our in-product feedback widget that can be installed in 5 minutes.


## Actively capture feedback

Collecting at the speed of thought is enabled by our Chrome extension and native integrations with apps like Slack and Intercom. Simply highlight, click, and you are ready to go.


## Proactively streamline user feedback

We call it "champagne problems" when you have thousands of feedback coming in everyday. But don't worry, you are well equipped to put the collecting and organizing in autopilot with us. Check out our integrations with Slack, Discord, Intercom, Zendesk, Twitter, etc.


## Snippets and Feedbacks

Turn feedback into actionable insights

Snippets are the distilled essence of the feedback we receive. These concise, categorized extracts are diligently triaged and processed to bring forth actionable insights that drive improvements.

With the power of our advanced AI model, each snippet displayed here has undergone a rigorous analysis to ensure relevance and clarity. But, for those moments when you wish to delve deeper, the original feedback text remains accessible, ensuring a comprehensive view.

Discover the transformation of raw feedback into invaluable insights right here on the Snippets page.
