As product builders, we all have experienced the extreme pain of setting up and switching between different platforms to capture feedback. We want to help you put that on autopilot by providing everything you need to collect and capture feedback. Thus, there are three categories of capture methods that you can find in Monterey:

## Proactively streamline user feedback

We call it "champagne problems" when you have thousands of feedback coming in everyday. But don't worry, you are well equipped to put the collecting and organizing in autopilot with us. Check out our integration guidances with Slack, Discord, Intercom, Zendesk, Twitter, etc on the integration tab.

## Actively capture feedback

Collecting at the speed of thought is enabled by our Chrome extension and native integrations with apps like Slack. Simply highlight, click, and you are ready to go.

## Allow users to submit feedback anytime anywhere

- To help startups jump-start collecting feedback, we provide a public feedback portal where your audience can vote on issues and requests.
- If you are looking for in-app feedback collection, check out our in-product feedback widget that can be installed in 5 minutes.
