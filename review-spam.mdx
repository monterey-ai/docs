We identify potential spam in advance, ensuring you're not wading through irrelevant input

### What You'll See:

- **Source**: Where did the feedback originate?
- **Customer**: Who provided this feedback?
- **Description**: A brief summary of the feedback content.

### Take Control with Actions:

- **Mark as Useful**: Found something that isn't spam? Simply single-click the green thumbs-up button. This moves the feedback to your inbox, marking it for further attention.
- **Confirm as Spam**: If you determine a feedback is indeed spam, a double click on the red thumbs-down button hides it permanently, ensuring your workspace remains clutter-free.
