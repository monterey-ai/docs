## Set up Widget

To set up your widget, go to [Widget settings](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/widget)

To enable the widget, you must add your website's domain(s) to the whitelist. Your widget will only work from domains that you have added to the whitelist. You can add multiple domains to the whitelist - simply add each domain you want to enable the widget for. This is useful if you need to run the widget across different environments (e.g., production and staging) or multiple websites.

After you've added your domain(s), copy the widget script and add it to your page's `<head>`.


## Configure Widget
You can modify the script by providing custom options to `Monterey("init")` or calling `Monterey("configure", options)`. Available options are below:

- `token: string` Do not modify this
- `showWidget: boolean` If `false`, the widget will be hidden and the widget modal must be toggled programmatically. See "Toggle Widget" below.
- `position: "bottom" | "top" | "left" | "right"` Changes the placement of the widget on the page
- `primaryColor: string` CSS color code to change the button primary color
- `secondaryColor: string` CSS color code to change the button secondary color
- `tags: string[]` Optional tags that all widget feedback will be tagged with

## Toggle Widget
If the widget is configured with `showWidget: false`, the widget modal can be toggled programmatically. To show or hide the modal,
call `Monterey("toggleWidget")`

## Identify Users
To associate your app users with feedback in Monterey, you must first identify them in our system.
To do this, call the identify function:
```
Monterey("identify", {
  name: user.name,
  email: user.email,
})
```
