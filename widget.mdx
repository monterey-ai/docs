## Set up Widget

To set up your widget, go to [Widget settings](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/settings/widget)

To enable the widget, you must add your website's domain to the whitelist. Your widget will only work from domains that you have added to the whitelist.

After you've added a domain, copy the widget script and add it to your page's `<head>`.


## Configure Widget
You can modify the script by providing custom options to `Monterey("init")` or calling `Monterey("configure", options)`. Available options are below:

- `token: string` Do not modify this
- `showWidget: boolean` If `false`, the widget will be hidden and the widget modal must be toggled programmatically. See "Toggle Widget" below.
- `position: "bottom" | "top" | "left" | "right"` Changes the placement of the widget on the page
- `primaryColor: string` CSS color code to change the button primary color
- `secondaryColor: string` CSS color code to change the button secondary color
- `tags: string[]` Optional tags that all widget feedback will be tagged with

## Toggle Widget
If the widget is configured with `showWidget: false`, the widget modal can be toggled programmatically. To show or hide the modal,
call `Monterey("toggleWidget")`

## Identify Users
To associate your app users with feedback in Monterey, you must first identify them in our system.
To do this, call the identify function:
```
Monterey("identify", {
  name: user.name,
  email: user.email,
})
```
