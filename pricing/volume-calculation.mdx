Monterey AI calculates volume based on the data automatically ingested by our system during your current billing cycle â€” **from the start to the end of your plan month**.
This method provides a clear picture of your usage within each billing period. Please note that different integrations with our platform can impact your volume in various ways, which we will explore further.

<Warning>
  Excessive deletions and re-ingestions of data may lead to the enforcement of
  usage limitations. This is to ensure fair usage and prevent circumvention of
  monthly caps.
</Warning>

## Integration-Specific Volume Calculation

Our platform processes various integrations uniquely, based on the complexity of the data involved. For instance, integrations handling more detailed or conversational data will lead to higher volume calculations due to the extra processing and resources required. Below is an overview of how these integrations affect your volume:
