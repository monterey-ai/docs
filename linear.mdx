At the bottom of the action bar, click the "Generate issue" button which will bring up a form requiring a title, team and assignee. You can also optionally include a description and project. After clicking on "Create issue", the Linear ticket will be created and found in the specified issue list or you can find it in My issues > created in Linear.


## User Access

Anyone who has access to your Monterey workspace can create a ticket in Linear, even if they do not have access to Linear themselves. Only users of Linear will be able to view and manage the ticket in Linear.
