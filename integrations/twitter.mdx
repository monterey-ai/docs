## Set up

Go to the [integration settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/) and select the Twitter integration option. In the search field, you can add any Twitter handles you wish to monitor for mentions. Then, save the change. All the mentioned tweets will be automatically imported into Monterey. Those tweets will be categorized in your Monterey [All Feedback](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/feedback) tab. 
Anyone who has access to your Monterey workspace can set up Twitter integration. 


## Use advanced query

Want to have advanced control on the tweets ingestion? We support advanced queries. You can use the Twitter docs or API explorer to build your query string [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query).
