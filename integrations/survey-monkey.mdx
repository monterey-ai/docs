### Overview

The integration with SurveyMonkey is a great way to get product insights with and from your survey results. With the integration, your team can:

- Finally make sense of non-categorical survey results
- Surface correlations between ratings and open-ended responses
- Understand trends of user sentiment across survey results

### Get Started

You can find the SurveyMonkey integration on yourÂ **[integration settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/survey-monkey)**.

A user with access to both Monterey AI as well as SurveyMonkey will need to authorize the connection.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Go to "Settings"' />
  <Step title='Click "Integrations" in the navigation menu' />
  <Step title='Click "SurveyMonkey"' />
  <Step title='Click "Connect"' />
  <Step title="If necessary, log in to SurveyMonkey using the appropriate account" />
  <Step title="Review and approve the permissions requested" />
  <Step title="Once confirmed, you will be returned to Monterey AI, where you can toggle on survey ingestion" />
</Steps>

### Ingest Responses

Once Monterey AI is authorized to access SurveyMonkey on your behalf, you can enable a setting on the **[integration settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/SurveyMonkey)** to have Monterey ingest new results data regularly. This process will run daily.

Initially, we will pull the latest 1 week of existing survey responses and then load new ones on an ongoing basis. Each response will be loaded into Monterey AI, however, only text / multiple choice responses will generate feedback. The remaining data will be appended as metadata and still filterable.

#### Data Collected

When ingesting surveys, we collect the following data and attributes from the SurveyMonkey API:

- Survey Metadata (Basic details such as the Survey id, name, type, creation time, etc.)
- Question information (Question id, name, ref, etc.)
- Response content (Response id, type, values, etc.)
