### Overview

HubSpot unifies sales, marketing, and customer data on a single platform. Connect this data with Reforge Insights to find more insights, and link feedback back to real customer value.

### Get Started

You can find the HubSpot integration on yourÂ settings/integrations page.

A user with access to both Reforge Insights as well as HubSpot will need to authorize the connection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to &#x22;Settings&#x22;" />

  <Step title="Click &#x22;Integrations&#x22; in the navigation menu" />

  <Step title="Click &#x22;HubSpot&#x22;" />

  <Step title="Click &#x22;Connect&#x22;" />

  <Step title="If necessary, log in to HubSpot using the appropriate account" />

  <Step title="Review and approve the permissions requested" />

  <Step title="Once confirmed, you will be returned to Reforge Insights, where you can toggle on ingestion of sales notes" />
</Steps>

### Data Collected

Once Reforge Insights and HubSpot are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Reforge Insights loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

Only notes from opportunities in the "Closed-Won" status will be ingested. This is to ensure that the feedback you receive is based on successful sales outcomes.

The following data attributes are loaded from HubSpot and utilized in Reforge Insights for analysis:

* Notes

  * Metadata (ID, created time, updated time)

  * Body (text content)

* Accounts

  * Metadata (ID, created time, updated time)

  * Name
