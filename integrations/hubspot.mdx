### Overview

HubSpot unifies sales, marketing, and customer data on a single platform. Connect this data with Reforge Insights to find more insights, and link feedback back to real customer value.

### Data Collected

Once Reforge Insights and HubSpot are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Reforge Insights loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

Only notes from opportunities in the "Closed-Won" status will be ingested. This is to ensure that the feedback you receive is based on successful sales outcomes.

The following data attributes are loaded from HubSpot and utilized in Reforge Insights for analysis:

- Notes
  - Metadata (ID, created time, updated time)
  - Body (text content)
- Accounts
  - Metadata (ID, created time, updated time)
  - Name
  - Description
  - About Us
  - Founded Year
