### Ingesting Messages

Reforge Insight Analytics will periodically pull in the latest messages from Discord. You can also manually refresh to load in the latest data at the [Discord settings page](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/settings/integrations/discord).

The system will automatically run messages or groups of messages through spam filtering to try and sift out the signal from the noise among conversations. If you find the filtering is too aggressive, or not aggressive enough, reach out to us and [let us know](mailto:support@monterey.ai?subject=Monterey+Spam+Filtering+Sensitivity+Request). We can adjust the sensitivity for you.

### Data Collected

When ingesting messages, we collect the following data:

- Metadata (Basic details such as the message ID, creation date, etc.)
- Content (The text of the message)
- Author (The ID and username of the message author)
- Channel ID that the message was posted to
