### Set up

You can find Discord integration on the [integration settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/). Follow the instructions to connect your Discord account. You can connect multiple channels from one Discord account to Monterey.
Only admins of your Monterey workspace can set up Discord integration.

If you are not able to find the channel(s) you wish to ingest from, or the channel(s) are disabled in the Monterey settings page, follow the instructions below to ensure the bot has appropriate access to the channel(s).

1. Invite "MontereyAI" to the channel you want to ingest data from (necessary if it is a private channel).
2. Right-click on the channel and select "Edit Channel".
3. Select the "Permissions" tab.
4. Click the "+" button to add a new role.
5. Name the role "MontereyAI" or another that is easy to identify and click "Create".
6. Under "General Channel Permissions", enable "View Channel"
7. Under "Text Channel Permissions", enable "Read Message History"
8. Click "Save Changes"

### Auto-ingested messages to feedbacks

Monterey will automatically retrieve messages from Discord channels on a daily basis, or you can manually fetch them anytime in the [Discord settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/discord).
If there is too much noise in your Discord channels, don't worry; our built-in auto-ingest feature will filter out spam messages from the message history for you.
