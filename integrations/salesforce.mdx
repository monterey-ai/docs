### Overview

Salesforce unifies sales, marketing, and customer data on a single platform. Connect this data with Reforge Insight Analytics to find more insights, and link feedback back to real customer value.

### Get Started

You can find the Salesforce integration on your **[integration settings page](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/settings/integrations/salesforce)**.

A user with access to both Reforge Insight Analytics as well as Salesforce will need to authorize the connection.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Go to "Settings"' />
  <Step title='Click "Integrations" in the navigation menu' />
  <Step title='Click "Salesforce"' />
  <Step title='Click "Connect"' />
  <Step title="If necessary, log in to Salesforce using the appropriate account" />
  <Step title="Review and approve the permissions requested" />
  <Step title="Once confirmed, you will be returned to Reforge Insight Analytics, where you can toggle on ingestion of sales notes" />
</Steps>

### Data Collected

Once Reforge Insight Analytics and Salesforce are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Reforge Insight Analytics loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

Only notes from opportunities in the "Closed-Won" status will be ingested. This is to ensure that the feedback you receive is based on successful sales outcomes and actual paying customers.

The following table describes how data is mapped from Salesforce into Reforge Insight Analytics.
