### Overview

Salesforce unifies sales, marketing, and customer data on a single platform. Connect this data with Monterey AI to find more insights, and link feedback back to real customer value.

### Get Started

You can find the Salesforce integration on yourÂ **[integration settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/salesforce)**.

A user with access to both Monterey AI as well as Salesforce will need to authorize the connection.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Go to "Settings"' />
  <Step title='Click "Integrations" in the navigation menu' />
  <Step title='Click "Salesforce"' />
  <Step title='Click "Connect"' />
  <Step title="If necessary, log in to Salesforce using the appropriate account" />
  <Step title="Review and approve the permissions requested" />
  <Step title="Once confirmed, you will be returned to Monterey AI, where you can toggle on ingestion of sales notes" />
</Steps>

### Data Collected

Once Monterey AI and Salesforce are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Monterey AI loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

Only notes from opportunities in the "Closed-Won" status will be ingested. This is to ensure that the feedback you receive is based on successful sales outcomes and actual paying customers.

The following table describes how data is mapped from Salesforce into Monterey AI.
