A user with access to both Monterey AI as well as Front will need to authorize the connection.

3. Click "Front"
4. Click "Connect"
5. If necessary, log in to Front using the appropriate account
6. Review and approve the permissions requested
7. Once confirmed, you will be returned to Monterey AI, where you can toggle on conversation ingestion


### Data Collected

Once Monterey AI and Front are connected successfully, data will be pulled from Front periodically. The first time Monterey AI loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

Each email thread that is accessible will be ingested, such that each message in the thread is viewable in Monterey. Only inbound messages will be analyzed for insights and other outputs in Monterey AI.

When ingesting email threads, we collect the following data and attributes from the Front API:
- Sender name and handle (e.g. email)
- Message subject and body (text content)
