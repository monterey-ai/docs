### Overview

The integration with Gong is a great way to get product insights with and from your Sales team. With the integration, your team can:

- Surface trends in customer calls
- Extract common feature requests, bug reports, and questions
- Understand commercial risks and opportunities from win - loss notes
- Summarize sales communications into actionable product insights

<Note>
  {" "}
  If this is a one time ingestion or low data volume, we recommend you upload via
  CSV or Zapier instead of building a continuous pipeline.
</Note>

  <Step title="Once confirmed, you will be returned to Monterey AI where you can select transcripts to analyze" />
</Steps>

### Data Collected

Once Gong is connected to Monterey, we will load a list of recent calls for you to select from.

For each call you select, we will load information including the following from the Gong API:

- Metadata (Basic details such as call date, title, call URL, etc)
- Parties (A list of the call's participants)
- Media (The media urls of the call)
- Content (Analysis of the interaction content)
- Interaction (Metrics collected around the interaction during the call)
- Collaboration (Collaboration information added to the call)
- Context (A list of links to external systems such as CRM, Dialer, Case Management, etc)
