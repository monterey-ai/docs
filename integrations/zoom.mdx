### Overview

The integration with Zoom is a great way to get product insights from your team meetings with customers. With the integration, your team can:

- Surface trends in customer meetings
- Extract common feature requests, bug reports, and questions
- Understand customer needs directly from meeting discussions
- Summarize meeting communications into actionable product insights

<Note>
  If this is a one time ingestion or low data volume, we recommend you upload via
  CSV or Zapier instead of building a continuous pipeline.
</Note>
