### Overview

The integration with Zoom is a great way to get product insights from your team meetings with customers. With the integration, your team can:

- Surface trends in customer meetings
- Extract common feature requests, bug reports, and questions
- Understand customer needs directly from meeting discussions
- Summarize meeting communications into actionable product insights

<Note>
  If this is a one time ingestion or low data volume, we recommend you upload via
  CSV or Zapier instead of building a continuous pipeline.
</Note>

### Get Started

### Data Collected

Once Zoom is connected to Reforge Insight Analytics, we will load a list of users for you to select from.

For each selected user, we will load recording information including the following from the Zoom API:

- Metadata (Basic details such as meeting date, title, meeting URL, etc)
- Participants (A list of the meeting's participants)
- Media (The media urls of the meeting)
- Meeting transcripts (The full transcript content of the meeting)
