### Overview

GitHub empowers open source projects to share and improve projects and stay up to date on all the issues and requests users submit. Connect GitHub to Reforge Insights to ingest your issues for analysis and insights.

### Get Started

You can find the GitHub integration on yourÂ [**integration settings page**](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/settings/integrations/github).

A user with access to both Reforge Insights as well as GitHub will need to authorize the connection.

1. Go to "Settings"
2. Click "Integrations" in the navigation menu
3. Click "GitHub"
4. Click "Connect"
5. If necessary, log in to GitHub using the appropriate account
6. Review and approve the permissions requested
7. Once confirmed, you will be returned to Reforge Insights, where you can toggle on ticket ingestion

### Data Collected

Once Reforge Insights and GitHub are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Reforge Insights loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

The following data attributes are loaded from GitHub and utilized in Reforge Insights for analysis:

- Issues
  - Metadata (ID, created time, updated time, url)
  - Title
  - Body
  - State
  - Labels
- Users (related to ingested tickets)
