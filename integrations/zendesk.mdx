### Overview

Zendesk empowers businesses to build better customer relationships through its service platform. By connecting Reforge Insights with Zendesk, you can go deeper, getting the insights your teams need to provide better service, support, and product.

### Data Collected

Once Reforge Insights and Zendesk are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Reforge Insights loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

Each ticket that is accessible will be ingested, such that the ticket and, if enabled, associated comments are analyzed and visible in Reforge Insights.

The following data attributes are loaded from Zendesk and utilized in Reforge Insights for analysis:

- Tickets
  - Metadata (ID, created time, updated time, type, channel, other association IDs)
  - Subject (text)
  - Description (text)
  - Tags
- Organizations (related to ingested tickets)
  - Metadata (ID, created time, updated time)
  - Domain
  - Name
  - Details (text)
- Users (related to ingested tickets)
  - Metadata (ID, created time, updated time)
  - Name
