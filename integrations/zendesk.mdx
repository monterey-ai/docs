### Data Collected

Once Monterey AI and Zendesk are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Monterey AI loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

The following data attributes are loaded from Zendesk and utilized in Monterey AI for analysis:
- Tickets
  - Metadata (ID, created time, updated time, type, channel, other association IDs)
