After connecting your Intercom account, you can customize exactly what data gets imported and how it's filtered. The Intercom integration allows you to import conversations, contacts, and companies from your Intercom instance with precise control over field selection and filtering criteria.

### Configuration Sections

#### 1. Choose Which Conversations to Include

##### **Include Bot-Only Conversations**

Enable this option to include conversations where a human agent was never involved. This allows you to analyze automated interactions and bot performance.

##### **Include Admin or Bot Initiated Conversations**

Enable this option to include conversations where an admin or bot initiated the first message. This helps capture proactive outreach and automated messaging campaigns.

#### 2. Narrow Down Your Conversations

Use filters to focus on specific types of conversations you want to analyze. This helps you import only the data that's relevant to your use case.

<Note>
  All filtering is based on conversation data. While you can filter using
  related contact or company fields, the filtering always applies to which
  conversations get imported.
</Note>

#### 3. Choose the Data to Include

</Warning>

<Info>
  **Preselected Fields**: Beyond the required fields, we automatically preselect additional commonly used fields to help you get started quickly with meaningful data. These preselected fields include useful metadata like contact activity, location information, device details, and company characteristics that are frequently needed for analysis. You can deselect any of these preselected fields if they're not relevant to your specific use case.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Standard Fields">
Standard Intercom fields that are available across all instances. These include common fields like:

- Include the custom field name and description
- Support all standard filtering and selection options

### Intercom Inbox App

Once the setup is done, you will see a Reforge Insights section in the Intercom details bar on the right when you open a conversation. It will bring up a form which requires a description. You can also optionally include a customer emails and customer names from the Intercom conversation, select a project. You can then create feedback directly Intercom by clicking “Create feedback”. The feedback will show up in “All feedback” tab in Reforge Insights auto categorized.

Anybody with access to your Intercom inbox will be able to send feedback to Reforge Insights, via the app in the sidebar, even if they do not have access to Reforge Insights. Only teammates added to Reforge Insights directly will be able to view feedback and insights.

### Data Collected

Once Reforge Insights and Intercom are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Reforge Insights loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

Each conversation that is accessible will be ingested, such that the conversation content is analyzed and visible in Reforge Insights.
