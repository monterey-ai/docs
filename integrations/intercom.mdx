### Intercom Inbox App

Once the setup is done, you will see a Reforge Insights section in the Intercom details bar on the right when you open a conversation. It will bring up a form which requires a description. You can also optionally include a customer emails and customer names from the Intercom conversation, select a project. You can then create feedback directly Intercom by clicking “Create feedback”. The feedback will show up in “All feedback” tab in Reforge Insights auto categorized.

Anybody with access to your Intercom inbox will be able to send feedback to Reforge Insights, via the app in the sidebar, even if they do not have access to Reforge Insights. Only teammates added to Reforge Insights directly will be able to view feedback and insights.

### Ingest Conversations

Once Reforge Insights is authorized to access Intercom on your behalf, you can enable a setting on the [integration settings page](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/settings/integrations/intercom) to have Reforge Insights ingest new conversation data regularly. This process will run every multiple times a day, up to hourly, depending on your subscription plan.

Initially, we will pull conversations up to 1 week old, and then load new ones on an ongoing basis. Each message in a conversation will be loaded into Reforge Insights, however, only messages coming from the external customer will be analyzed.

#### Data Collected

When ingesting conversations, we collect the following data and attributes from the Intercom API:

- Metadata (Basic details such as the conversation ID, URL, creation date, etc.)
- Message text content (only those of type `Comment` that are **not redacted**)
- Message Authors (Name, Email, Type)

#### User Properties

When ingesting Authors, we also allow users to collect the following data and attributes from Intercom, including user properties such as plan tier, geographic data, and any segment data that helps with feedback analysis.
