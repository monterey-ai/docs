## Overview

The Fathom integration for Reforge Insights allows you to automatically import video call transcripts from Fathom into your Reforge Insights workspace. This integration leverages Zapier to connect Fathom's "New Transcript" events with Reforge Insights, enabling you to analyze customer conversations, extract insights, and share them with your team.

## Benefits

- **Automatic transcript import**: No need to manually copy and paste transcripts from Fathom
- **Preserve meeting context**: Maintain all participant information, timestamps, and recording links
- **Centralize customer conversations**: Keep all your customer feedback in one place for analysis
- **Quick setup**: Connect in minutes with no coding required

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Fathom integration, you'll need:

1. A Reforge Insights account with admin access
2. A Fathom account
3. A Zapier account (free or paid)
4. An API key from your Reforge Insights workspace

## Setup

### Getting your API Key

For detailed instructions on obtaining your API key, please refer to the [Zapier integration documentation](/integrations/zapier#getting-your-api-key).

### Creating the Zap

1. Go to the [Zapier Dashboard](https://zapier.com/app/dashboard)
2. Click on "Create Zap" to start building a new automation
3. For the trigger, search for and select "Fathom"
4. Choose "New Transcript" as the trigger event
5. Connect your Fathom account when prompted
6. Test the trigger to ensure it's working correctly

### Configuring the Action

1. For the action, search for and select "Reforge Insights"
2. Choose "Submit New Fathom Transcript" as the action
3. Connect your Reforge Insights account using your API key
4. Map the fields from Fathom to Reforge Insights as described in the next section

## Field Mapping

When setting up the Zap, you'll need to map fields from Fathom to the corresponding fields in Reforge Insights. Here's how to map each required field:

| Reforge Insights Field | Fathom Field                              |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Transcript ID                   | ID                                        |
| Transcript                      | Transcript Plaintext                      |
| Recording URL                   | Recording URL (from the recording object) |
| Meeting Scheduled Start Time    | Meeting Scheduled Start Time              |
| Meeting Title                   | Meeting Title                             |
| Fathom User Name                | Fathom User Name                          |
| Fathom User Email               | Fathom User Email                         |
| Invitees                        | See below for mapping invitees            |

### Mapping Invitees

For the invitees field, you'll need to map the meeting participants from Fathom. Zapier will allow you to add multiple invitees:

1. Click "Add another invitee" for each participant in the meeting
2. Map each invitee with the following fields:
   - **Invitee Name**: Meeting Invitees Name
   - **Invitee Email**: Meeting Invitees Email
   - **Invitee Is External**: Meeting Invitees Is External

If you have multiple invitees, you can use Zapier's "Line Items" feature to dynamically map all participants.

## Testing Your Zap

After configuring the field mapping:

1. Click "Test & Continue" to test the action
2. Zapier will send a sample transcript to Reforge Insights
3. Check your Reforge Insights workspace to verify the transcript was imported correctly
4. If successful, name your Zap (e.g., "Fathom Transcripts to Reforge Insights") and turn it on

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Fathom integration:

1. **Check field mapping**: Ensure all required fields are properly mapped
2. **Verify API key**: Make sure you're using a valid API key from your Reforge Insights workspace
3. **Review Zap history**: Check the Zap history in Zapier to see detailed error messages
4. **Test with sample data**: Use Zapier's testing features to verify each step is working correctly

For additional help with Zapier setup, please refer to our [Zapier integration documentation](/integrations/zapier#troubleshooting).

## Limitations

- The integration will only import new transcripts created after the Zap is activated
- Very long transcripts may be truncated due to Zapier's data size limitations
- The integration requires both Fathom and Reforge Insights accounts to remain connected in Zapier

## Access

Only administrators of your Reforge Insights workspace can set up the Fathom integration through Zapier.
