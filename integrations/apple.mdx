### Data Collected

After connecting an app, we will start by ingesting the most recent 500 reviews. After that, we will fetch all new reviews on an ongoing basis. This happens nightly.

The attributes we collect from reviews are the following:
- Metadata (ID, app ID, dates)
- Title
- Description
- Rating
