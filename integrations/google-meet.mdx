<Warning>This integration is in development</Warning>

### Overview

The integration with Google Meet is a great way to get product insights from your team meetings with customers. With the integration, your team can:

- Surface trends in customer meetings
- Extract common feature requests, bug reports, and questions
- Understand customer needs directly from meeting discussions
- Summarize meeting communications into actionable product insights

<Note>
  If this is a one time ingestion or low data volume, we recommend you upload
  via CSV or Zapier instead of building a continuous pipeline.
</Note>

### Prerequisites

- Access to Reforge Insights
- Meeting recordings with transcripts saved
