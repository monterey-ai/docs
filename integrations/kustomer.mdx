### Overview

Kustomer is a customer service platform that helps businesses deliver exceptional customer service. By connecting Reforge Insight Analytics with Kustomer, you can go deeper, getting the insights your teams need to provide better service, support, and product.

### Requirements

- You will require a Kustomer account on the Professional, Business, Enterprise, or Ultimate plan levels.
- You will need a user in Kustomer with admin permissions.

### Get Started

First, you will need to generate an API key in Kustomer.com.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Go to "Settings"' />
  <Step title='Click "Security" in the navigation menu' />
  <Step title='Click "API Keys"' />
  <Step title='Click "Add API Key"' />
  <Step title='Enter "Reforge Insight Analytics" for the "Name" attribute' />
  <Step title="Apply the following roles for the API Key: `org.permission.conversation.read`, `org.permission.message.read`, `org.permission.customer.read`, and `org.permission.tag.read`." />
  <Step title='Click "Create"' />
  <Step title='Copy the generated "Token" value and save for later.' />
</Steps>

Now that you have an API key, you can find the Kustomer integration in Reforge Insight Analytics atÂ **[integration settings page](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/settings/integrations/kustomer)**.
Note that the link will take you to the first workspace you have access to, so you may need to change it using the Workspace selector at the top left of the screen.

  <Step title='Go to "Settings"' />
  <Step title='Click "Integrations" in the navigation menu' />
  <Step title='Click "Kustomer"' />
  <Step title="Pase the API Key that you created in Kustomer" />
  <Step title='Click "Save" and the system will validate the API key and confirm it has necessary roles.' />
  <Step title="Once confirmed, you will be returned to Reforge Insight Analytics, where you can toggle on ticket ingestion" />
  <Step title="[Optional] You can also enable each comment on the Kustomer tickets to be ingested" />
</Steps>
