- Create feedback directly from Slack messages

### Connect Workspace

  <Step title="Choose Features">
    We only ask for the permissions that are necessary for the features you plan

To begin pulling conversations into Monterey for analysis, you will need to select the channels you want to ingest.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Click "Add Channel"'>
    This will open a menu where you can search and select channels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Ingest">
    Ensure that the "Ingest" toggle is enabled for each channel you want to

  If you do not see the channel you want to ingest, you may need to invite the
  Monterey app to the channel. Once this is done, click the "Refresh Channels"
  button.
