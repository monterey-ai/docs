## Overview

The Slack integration makes it effortless to stay on top of customer feedback and insights directly within your team's workspace. With the integration, your team can:

- Uncover insights from channels shared with customers
- Interact with [Ask Monty](/ask-monty) via chat conversations
- Get alerts in chosen Slack channels for new feedback, theme reports, and weekly digests
- Create feedback directly from Slack messages

## Setup

To get started, navigate to the [**integration setting page**](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/settings/integrations/) and select **Slack**.

### Connect Workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title='Click "Connect Monterey to Slack"'>
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Features">
    We only ask for the permissions that are necessary for the features you plan
    to use.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Click "Connect"'>
    This will take you to Slack to review and approve the permissions we
    request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Depending on your workspace settings, you may need to ask your Slack admin to
  approve the integration. After approval, you will need to repeat the steps to
  connect the integration.

If you want to remove the integration, you can find the instructions
[**here**](https://slack.com/help/articles/360003125231-Remove-apps-and-custom-integrations-from-your-workspace).

### Feedback Ingestion

To begin pulling conversations into Reforge Insights for analysis, you will need to select the channels you want to ingest.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Click "Add Channel"'>
    This will open a menu where you can search and select channels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Ingest">
    Ensure that the "Ingest" toggle is enabled for each channel you want to
    ingest.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If you do not see the channel you want to ingest, you may need to invite the
  Monterey app to the channel. Once this is done, click the "Refresh Channels"
  button.
</Note>

### Configuring Notifications

We route our notifications through filter criteria set up in [Views](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/views). From the [Views creation page,](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/views/create) you can choose channels for:

- Individual Feedback
- Weekly Summary
- Overall Themes

<Warning>
  If your workspace has high feedback volume, use caution when enabling
  notifications.
</Warning>

## Features

### Create feedback from DM, channel, and thread

Create feedback directly in Slack by clicking on the three dots menu from a message. You will see a pop up window with pre-populated description field that is pulled from the message.

Anyone who has access to the specified Slack channel can create feedback from slack to Reforge Insights even when they do not have access. Only Reforge Insights teammates will be able to view feedback in Reforge Insights.
