### Overview

Reforge Insight Analytics can connect to and pull data from your data warehouse of choice. Currently, we support Snowflake, but are always looking to expand our integrations.

### Snowflake

To connect with Snowflake, you can request our account details and use [Secure Data Sharing](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro).
Secure data sharing allows you to give us the targeted access to just the data you want to share.

### Schemas

We support several schemas and relationships between tables. With each of the schemas defined below, you can also provide a list of additional column names that you would like to be included on the respective fields as **metadata**. A few examples of common additional fields are for feedback or conversation messages, a "version" number that the feedback refers to, or for Contacts, a "plan" or "subscription tier". When working with the team to connect to your data warehouse, simply share with us fields beyond those defined below that you would like to have included!
