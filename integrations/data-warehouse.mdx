### Overview

Monterey AI can connect to and pull data from your data warehouse of choice. Currently, we support Snowflake, but are always looking to expand our integrations.

### Snowflake

To connect with Snowflake, you can request our account details and use [Secure Data Sharing](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro).
Secure data sharing allows you to give us the targeted access to just the data you want to share.
