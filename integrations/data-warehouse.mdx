# Overview

Reforge Insights can connect to and pull data from your data warehouse of choice. Currently, we support Snowflake and BigQuery, but are always looking to expand our integrations.

# Supported Warehouses

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Snowflake">
    <h3>Secure Data Sharing (Preferred)</h3>
    To connect with Snowflake, you can request our account details and use [Secure Data Sharing](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro).
    Secure data sharing allows you to give us the targeted access to just the data you want to share.

    <h3>Service User (Alternative)</h3>
    If setting up secure data sharing is not an option, you can instead create a service user with a password and share the credentials with us.  Create a role for the service user and grant it
    read access on the tables you wish to connect.  Then share the following with us:
    - account url
    - username
    - key pair or password (if using a key pair, you will need to provide the private key)
    - role
    - warehouse
    - database

    We connect to Snowflake using the following IP addresses, which you may need to whitelist in your Snowflake account:
    ```
    34.212.54.206
    35.162.156.254
    44.241.212.223
    44.240.0.247
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="BigQuery">
    To connect with BigQuery:

    <Steps>
      <Step>Request our Google Cloud service account details from your primary contact at Reforge.</Step>
      <Step>
        Add the service account email address to your Google Cloud IAM policy and grant it the `bigquery.jobUser` _(BigQuery
        Job User)_ role. This will allow us to run queries on your behalf.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Share the dataset containing tables, like those described below, with our service account email address and grant it
        the `bigquery.dataViewer` _(BigQuery Data Viewer)_ role. This will provide us with read-only access to the datasets
        you want to share.
      </Step>
      <Step>Share with your primary contact at Reforge the respective Google Cloud project ID and dataset ID.</Step>
    </Steps>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Amazon Redshift">
    To connect with Amazon Redshift using Datashare:

        <Steps>
          <Step>
            Create a datashare in your Redshift cluster:
        ```sql
        CREATE DATASHARE ingest_share;
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Add objects to your datashare. You can add entire schemas or specific tables and views:
        ```sql
        -- Whole schema
        ALTER DATASHARE ingest_share ADD SCHEMA public;

        -- Or pick specific items
        ALTER DATASHARE ingest_share ADD TABLE public.conversations;
        ALTER DATASHARE ingest_share ADD VIEW public.latest_tickets_v;
        ```

      </Step>
      <Step>
        Make the datashare visible cross-account:
        ```sql
        ALTER DATASHARE ingest_share SET PUBLICACCESSIBLE TRUE;
        ```
        Note: This doesn't expose your data publicly. It only allows consumption by authorized accounts.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Authorize Reforge's AWS account to access your datashare:
        ```bash
        aws redshift authorize-data-share \
          --data-share-arn arn:aws:redshift:us-east-1:111122223333:datashare:ingest_share \
          --consumer-accounts 44445556677
        ```
        Replace the ARN with your datashare ARN and the consumer-accounts value with the AWS account ID provided to you by your Reforge contact.

        You can also do this via the Redshift console under **Datashares → ingest_share → Authorize**.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Provide the following information to your primary contact at Reforge:

        | **Field** | **Example** |
        | --- | --- |
        | **Datashare ARN** | arn:aws:redshift:us-east-1:111122223333:datashare:ingest_share |
        | **Redshift namespace ARN** (only if you have multiple clusters/workgroups) | arn:aws:redshift:us-east-1:111122223333:namespace:prod-ns-1 |
        | **List of schemas / tables / views** included | public.conversations, public.latest_tickets_v |

      </Step>

# Data Models

We support several schemas and relationships between tables. With each of the schemas defined below, you can also provide a list of additional column names that you would like to be included on the respective fields as **metadata**. A few examples of common additional fields are for feedback or conversation messages, a "version" number that the feedback refers to, or for Contacts, a "plan" or "subscription tier". When working with the team to connect to your data warehouse, simply share with us fields beyond those defined below that you would like to have included!

### Custom Tables

Sometimes, you may not be able to map your data to the existing schemas. In this case, you can share your own, existing tables. This will require custom engineering work on our end, so understand that time will be required to support this.

If you are providing custom tables, then what we will need to do is to effectively write custom queries and map the data to schemas above on our end.
Given that, helping us understand how to do that mapping will expedite the process and lead to better, faster results for getting your data into Reforge Insights.

When sharing custom table information, please provide the following:

**1. Table Information**
The table names, column names, column types, and a description of the data in each column.
