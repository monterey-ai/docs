# Overview

Reforge Insight Analytics can connect to and pull data from your data warehouse of choice. Currently, we support Snowflake and BigQuery, but are always looking to expand our integrations.

# Supported Warehouses

### Snowflake

To connect with Snowflake, you can request our account details and use [Secure Data Sharing](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro).
Secure data sharing allows you to give us the targeted access to just the data you want to share.

### BigQuery

To connect with BigQuery:

<Steps>
  <Step>Request our Google Cloud service account details from your primary contact at Reforge.</Step>
  <Step>
    Add the service account email address to your Google Cloud IAM policy and grant it the `bigquery.jobUser` _(BigQuery
    Job User)_ role. This will allow us to run queries on your behalf.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Share the dataset containing tables, like those described below, with our service account email address and grant it
    the `bigquery.dataViewer` _(BigQuery Data Viewer)_ role. This will provide us with read-only access to the datasets
    you want to share.
  </Step>
  <Step>Share with your primary contact at Reforge the respective Google Cloud project ID and dataset ID.</Step>
</Steps>

# Data Models

We support several schemas and relationships between tables. With each of the schemas defined below, you can also provide a list of additional column names that you would like to be included on the respective fields as **metadata**. A few examples of common additional fields are for feedback or conversation messages, a "version" number that the feedback refers to, or for Contacts, a "plan" or "subscription tier". When working with the team to connect to your data warehouse, simply share with us fields beyond those defined below that you would like to have included!
