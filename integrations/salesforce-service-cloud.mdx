### Data Collected

Once Monterey AI and Salesforce Service Cloud are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Monterey AI loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

Each case that is accessible will be ingested, such that the case and, if enabled, associated comments are analyzed and visible in Monterey AI.

The following data attributes are loaded from Salesforce Service Cloud and utilized in Monterey AI for analysis:
- Cases
