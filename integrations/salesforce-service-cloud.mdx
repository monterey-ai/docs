### Overview

Salesforce Service Cloud empowers businesses to build better customer relationships through its service platform. By connecting Monterey AI with Salesforce Service Cloud, you can go deeper, getting the insights your teams need to provide better service, support, and product.

### Get Started

You can find the Salesforce Service Cloud integration on yourÂ **[integration settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/salesforce)**.

A user with access to both Monterey AI as well as Salesforce Service Cloud will need to authorize the connection.

<Steps>
  <Steps title='Go to "Settings"' />
  <Steps title='Click "Integrations" in the navigation menu' />
  <Steps title='Click "Salesforce"' />
  <Steps title='Click "Connect"' />
  <Steps title="If necessary, log in to Salesforce using the appropriate account" />
  <Steps title="Review and approve the permissions requested" />
  <Steps title="Once confirmed, you will be returned to Monterey AI, where you can toggle on case ingestion" />
  <Steps title="[Optional] You can also enable each comment on the salesforce cases to be ingested" />
</Steps>

### Data Collected

Once Monterey AI and Salesforce Service Cloud are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Monterey AI loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

Each case that is accessible will be ingested, such that the case and, if enabled, associated comments are analyzed and visible in Monterey AI.

The following table describes how data is mapped from Salesforce into Monterey AI.
