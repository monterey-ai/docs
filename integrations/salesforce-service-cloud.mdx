### Data Collected

Once Reforge Insight Analytics and Salesforce Service Cloud are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Reforge Insight Analytics loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.

Each case that is accessible will be ingested, such that the case and, if enabled, associated comments are analyzed and visible in Reforge Insight Analytics.

The following table describes how data is mapped from Salesforce into Reforge Insight Analytics.
