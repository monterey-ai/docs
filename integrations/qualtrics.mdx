- Understand trends of user sentiment across survey results
- Consolidate survey data with other feedback sources for comprehensive insights

### Configure Survey Ingestion

Once Reforge Insights is authorized to access Qualtrics on your behalf, you can configure which surveys to ingest and how to map survey questions to feedback data.

#### Select Surveys

On the integration settings page, you can:

- **Load Latest Data**: Sync the most recent survey responses
- **Refresh Surveys List**: Update the available surveys from your Qualtrics account
- Toggle individual surveys on or off for ingestion

#### Configure Question Mappings

For each enabled survey, you can map questions to different data types:

- **Feedback Content**: Open-ended responses that will be analyzed for themes and insights
- **Feedback Metadata**: Additional context that will be attached to feedback records
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for the survey respondent (_choose ONE per survey_)
- **Customer Name**: Name of the survey respondent (_choose ONE per survey_)
- **Customer Email**: Email address of the survey respondent (_choose ONE per survey_)
- **Customer Metadata**: Additional customer attributes for segmentation and filtering

This flexible mapping allows you to customize how survey data flows into Reforge Insights based on your survey structure and analysis needs.

### Ingest Responses

Once configured, Reforge Insights will regularly ingest new survey response data. This process runs multiple times per day, up to hourly, depending on your subscription plan.

Initially, we will pull existing survey responses for selected surveys, and then load new ones on an ongoing basis. Each response will be processed according to your question mappings, with text responses generating analyzable feedback and other data types providing context and metadata.

#### Data Collected

When ingesting surveys, we collect the following data and attributes from the Qualtrics API:

- Survey Metadata (Survey ID, name, creation date, status, etc.)
  - Any Qualtrics "embedded" fields will be added as metadata to the feedback record
- Question information (Question ID, type, text, response options, etc.)
- Response content (Response ID, values, completion status, timestamps, etc.)
- Respondent information (as configured in your question mappings)
