### Overview

The integration with Typeform is a great way to get product insights with and from your survey results. With the integration, your team can:

- Finally make sense of non-categorical survey results
- Surface correlations between ratings and open-ended responses
- Understand trends of user sentiment across survey results

### Get Started

You can find the Typeform integration on yourÂ **[integration settings page](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/settings/integrations/Typeform)**.

A user with access to both Reforge Insight Analytics as well as Typeform will need to authorize the connection.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Go to "Settings"' />
  <Step title='Click "Integrations" in the navigation menu' />
  <Step title='Click "Typeform"' />
  <Step title='Click "Connect"' />
  <Step title="If necessary, log in to Typeform using the appropriate account" />
  <Step title="Review and approve the permissions requested" />
  <Step title="Once confirmed, you will be returned to Reforge Insight Analytics, where you can toggle on survey ingestion" />
</Steps>

### Ingest Responses

Once Reforge Insight Analytics is authorized to access Typeform on your behalf, you can enable a setting on the **[integration settings page](https://insights.reforge.com/w/default/settings/integrations/Typeform)** to have Reforge Insight Analytics ingest new results data regularly. This process will run daily.

Initially, we will pull ALL existing survey responses for selected surveys, and then regularly load new ones on an ongoing basis. Each response will be loaded into Reforge Insight Analytics, however, only text / multiple choice responses will generate feedback. The remaining data will be appended as metadata and still filterable.

#### Data Collected

When ingesting surveys, we collect the following data and attributes from the Typeform API:

- Survey Metadata (Basic details such as the Survey id, name, type, creation time, etc.)
- Question information (Question id, name, ref, etc.)
- Response content (Response id, type, values, etc.)
