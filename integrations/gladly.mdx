### Overview

Gladly empowers businesses to build better customer relationships through its service platform. By connecting Monterey AI with Gladly, you can go deeper, getting the insights your teams need to provide better service, support, and product.

### Get Started

You can find the Gladly integration on your **[integration settings page](https://app.monterey.ai/w/default/settings/integrations/gladly)**.

A user with access to both Monterey AI as well as Gladly will need to authorize the connection.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Go to "Settings"' />
  <Step title='Click "Integrations" in the navigation menu' />
  <Step title='Click "Gladly"' />
  <Step title="Enter your username from Gladly" />
  <Step title='Enter your subdomain, e.g. if your Gladly domain is "mycompany.gladly.com", enter "mycompany"' />
  <Step title="Enter your API key, which can be found in your Gladly account settings">
    You can utilize Gladly's documentation to help find your API key by visiting
    this link:
    [https://connect.gladly.com/docs/implementation/article/get-your-api-tokens/](https://connect.gladly.com/docs/implementation/article/get-your-api-tokens/)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Once confirmed, you are complete.">
    Monterey AI will begin ingesting your Gladly conversations periodically
    throughout the day. You can trigger a manual refresh from the integration
    settings page.
  </Step>

### Setting Up Multiple Domains

If you need to connect multiple Gladly domains, you can add additional connections by following these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Go to "Settings"' />
  <Step title='Click "Integrations" in the navigation menu' />
  <Step title='Click "Add New Connection" on the Gladly integration card' />
  <Step title="Follow the same setup process as above with the credentials for your additional domain">
    Each domain connection will require its own username, subdomain, and API key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each domain connection will operate independently, and data from all connected domains will be available in your Monterey AI workspace.

### Data Collected

Once Monterey AI and Gladly are connected successfully, data will be pulled from periodically. The first time Monterey AI loads data, it will look back 1 week. After that, it will ingest all new data up to your plan's feedback volume limit.
