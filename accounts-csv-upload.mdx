## CSV Format

Your CSV file should contain the following columns:

- `name` - The account/company name
- `domain` - The company's domain (e.g., "example.com")
- `contractValue` - The account's contract value (numeric)
- **Additional columns** - Any other columns will be stored as metadata on the account

## How Accounts Are Matched

When importing accounts, the system attempts to match each row with existing accounts using the following logic:

1. **First**, looks for an existing account with matching `domain` in your workspace.
2. If no match by domain, looks for an existing account with matching `name` in your workspace.
3. If a match is found:
   - Updates the account with new data while preserving existing data.
   - Merges any new metadata fields with existing metadata.
4. If no match is found and either `name` or `domain` is provided:
   - Creates a new account with the provided data.

## Required Fields

You must provide at least one of:

- `name`
- `domain`

Rows missing both fields will be skipped.

## Data Validation

- `name` and `domain` are validated as strings.
- `contractValue` is converted to a number if valid, otherwise ignored.
- All other columns are stored as metadata on the account.

## Best Practices

1. **Include domain when possible** - this provides the most reliable account matching.
2. **Use consistent naming** - accounts are matched exactly on name.
3. **Include any additional fields you want to track as metadata columns.**
4. **Review your CSV data before upload to ensure accuracy.**

## What Happens During Import

1. **System validates all rows in your CSV.**
2. For each valid row:
   - Attempts to match existing accounts.
   - Updates matched accounts or creates new ones.
   - Preserves existing data while adding new data.

## Supported File Types

The account import accepts the `.csv` and `.xlsx` files
