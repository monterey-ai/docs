## Overview

The Reforge Insights MCP (Model Context Protocol) server provides direct access to your feedback data through AI clients like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, ChatGPT, and others. This integration allows you to query your insights data naturally using AI assistants.

## Installation

To install, follow the directions for the client of your choice below. After you connect your client, you will need to restart the client in order to load the tools and authenticate. If you normally sign in to Reforge Insights from a specific browser or browser profile, ensure that it was the last browser active. The authentication process will ask you to sign in, or if you are already signed in, it will quickly open and close your browser.
