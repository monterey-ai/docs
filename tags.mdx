### Creating Tags

- **Add new tags** for projects, teams, features, or other focus areas.
- Tags are especially helpful for unique or specific feature names, project codenames, or internal company terms that may be more difficult for our AI to detect and understand.
- Each tag includes:
  - A **short label** and **description** for clarity
  - An optional **color** for easy recognition
  - A **tag group** for organization

### Auto-triage & AI labeling

- Use **auto-triage** to automatically label new feedback as it comes in.
- This trains the system’s AI model to **sort future feedback into the right clusters**, improving the accuracy of themes and reports.
- Once you've added a tag, you'll have the option of reviewing a few existing snippets to apply the new tag to help kickstart labeling.

### Managing Tags

- **Edit or move** tags between groups anytime.

- **Delete tags** you no longer need.

### Training your data

- In **Data training**, you’ll see a selection of feedback snippets.
- Assigning tags here **teaches the AI model** how to classify similar feedback in the future.
- In some cases, you'll see a recommended tag to assign based on the snippet content.
- Over time, this makes your feedback clustering and insights more precise.

### Syncing data

- Within a **tag group** or across all tags, you can **sync your data** after adding or editing tags.
- Syncing updates your AI model to ensure feedback is categorized correctly in future analyses.

### Viewing tagged feedback

- From any tag or tag group, you can see **all feedback snippets** associated with it.
- From the **Snippets** page, review and manually adjust tags on individual feedback items.
- This gives teams a focused view of customer input for their specific area of work.

Tags ensure that as your feedback grows, it stays **organized, accurately clustered**, and actionable for everyone on your team.
