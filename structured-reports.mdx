## Intro

Monterey's structured report automatically categorizes and groups feedback into similar types, themes and source. The report is generated in real time with a basic analysis of the percentage of each feedback theme out of the total number of feedback, which allows you to quickly uncover the insights of your feedback data.

## How is the report generated?

When you enter your data into Monterey, our AI models will automatically sort the feedback data into categories such as "Feature", "Appreciation", "Bug" and "Questions". It will also analyze the feedback and identify any common themes. The structured report is a basic summary of the analysis results.

## Themes and actions

The report is sorted by the number of feedback associated with each theme. To view and take action on a relevant feedback, click on the title of each theme and open the individual feedback. The action bar can be found to the right of the detailed view of each feedback.

## Limitations

Less data means more bias. To provide a minimum viable report, Monterey only generates reports for at least 200 feedback entries.
