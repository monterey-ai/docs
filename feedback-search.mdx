### Filter, Search & Display

- **Filtering**: Streamline your view by applying filters such as creation time, category, priority, and more. You can even get granular with metadata filters like URL or username.
- **Search**: Not sure which filter to apply? Use the search bar in the navigation panel on the left, or press `control-k` (or `command-k` on Mac), then enter the keyword you are looking for. Matching feedback will appear, or you can directly Ask Monty this way, too.
- **Display Preferences**: Personalize your view by adjusting the columns displayed. Choose from options like source, content, customer, category, projects, and created date.
