## Conversation Management

### Saving Conversations

Important conversations can be saved for future reference:

1. Complete your analysis in a conversation
2. Click "Save" in the conversation menu
3. Find it later in your "Saved" list

**Use saved conversations for:**

- Recurring analysis (weekly, monthly reviews)
- Reference examples for your team
- Templates for common questions
- Audit trail of insights

### Sharing Conversations

Share insights with anyone:

1. Generate a public share link
2. Recipients can view the conversation
3. They see all questions, datasets, and responses
4. No login required for viewers

![share-conversation](/images/monty/shareChat.png)

**What's included in shared links:**

- Full conversation thread
- All responses (text, charts, examples)
- Dataset information (not full data)
- Public view only (no editing)

**Use cases:**

- Share insights with stakeholders
- Include in reports and presentations
- Collaborate with other teams
- Customer-facing reports

## Alternative Entry Points

You can also start a conversation from the following places:

- Custom reports
- Filtered feedback snippet views
- The survey analysis page
- The interview analysis page

When coming from these locations, the original query will be pre-filtered based on the feedback filters present in the view.
For example, if you are coming from a report around "checkout bugs", and ask, "how's it been going the past week?", the chat will center around a dataset of checkout bugs from the last week.

## Metadata and Custom Fields

### Using Metadata in Questions

If you have custom metadata fields configured:

```
"Show feedback by app version"
"Compare feedback from paid vs free users"
"What are enterprise customers saying?"
"Chart bugs by operating system version"
```

### Available Metadata Types

- **Feedback metadata**: Version, platform, environment
- **Customer metadata**: Plan tier, signup date, status
- **Account metadata**: Company size, industry, ARR

To enable metadata for use in your worksapce, navigate to Settings -> Metadata, and enable "Chat Use" for each metadata key you want to use.
_Note: Metadata is only available for up to 10 metadata keys per workspace at this time._

### Filtering by Metadata

```
"Summarize feedback where app_version is 2.5.0"
"Show bugs from users on the pro plan"
"Compare feedback across different company sizes"
```

## Competitor Analysis

If you have competitors configured:

### Creating Competitor Datasets

```
"What are customers saying about [Competitor]?"
"Show feedback mentioning [Competitor's feature]"
"Compare our pricing to [Competitor]'s pricing in customer feedback"
```

![competitor-analysis](/images/monty/competitors.png)

### Competitor vs Your Product

```
"Compare feedback about our checkout to [Competitor]'s checkout"

→ Dataset 1: Your checkout feedback
→ Dataset 2: Competitor mentions in your feedback
→ Comparative analysis
```

### Analyzing Competitor Feedback

Monty can analyze:

- **Comparison mentions**: "X is better than Y"
- **Feature requests**: "Add Z like competitor has"
- **Migration reasons**: "Switched from/to competitor"
