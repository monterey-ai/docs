# What is Ask Monty?

Ask Monty is your intelligent assistant for exploring and analyzing customer feedback. Using advanced AI, Monty helps you understand what your customers are saying, identify trends, compare feedback across different segments, and generate actionable insightsâ€”all through a natural conversation.

## How It Works

Ask Monty operates like a research assistant. You ask questions in plain English, and Monty:

1. **Understands your query** - Identifies what data you need and what filters to apply
2. **Gathers the data** - Creates focused datasets from your feedback, surveys, or external sources
3. **Analyzes and responds** - Generates summaries, charts, examples, or documents to answer your question

The best part? You can ask follow-up questions, refine your analysis, and dive deeperâ€”all in one conversation.

## Key Capabilities

### ðŸ“Š Multiple Response Types

Monty adapts its response format to best answer your question:

- **Text Summaries**: Get concise overviews, thematic analyses, and qualitative comparisons
- **Charts & Visualizations**: See trends over time, distributions, and comparisons across categories
- **Feedback Examples**: Browse actual customer quotes and snippets relevant to your query
- **Documents**: Generate draft PRDs, reports, and other structured documents

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Data Filtering

Monty automatically extracts filters from your questions:

- Time ranges ("last 30 days", "Q1 2024")
- Feedback sources ("from app store reviews", "Intercom messages")
- Categories and projects
- Tags and metadata
- Customer segments (plan tier, contract value, etc.)

### ðŸ”— Citations & Traceability

Every insight links back to the original feedback, so you can:

- Verify Monty's findings

- Share evidence with your team

### ðŸ’¾ Save & Share

- Save important questions for future reference
- Export datasets to CSV
- Create cohorts from your analysis

- Knows your entire feedback history
- Can instantly filter and segment data
- Creates visualizations on demand
- Summarizes findings in plain language
- Remembers your conversation context
