## Set up
Go to the [intigration setting page](../https://app.monterey.ai/w/cl5b6pdc45011ebfde64e4qkf/settings/integrations/) and select the Jira integration option. Follow the guidelines to connet your Jira account. Only admins of your Monterey workspace can set up Jira integration. 


## Usage

You can create a ticket for any individual feedback from the Monterey workspace. Click on each feedback and you will see a feedback detail view with an action bar to the right. At the bottom of the action bar, click the "Generate issue" button which will bring up a form requiring a title, team and assignee. You can also optionally include a description and project. After clicking on "Create issue", the Jira ticket will be created and found in the specified issue list in Jira.


## User Access

Anyone with access to your Monterey workspace can create a ticket in Jira, even if they don't have a Jira account. Only users with a Jira account will be able to view and manage the ticket in Jira.
