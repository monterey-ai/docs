Currently, Monterey AI supports two distinct user roles: **admin** and **Member**. Generally, admin users can manage settings such as integrations and workspace details, while members can only interact with the system outside of settings.

Chats, aside from those that are "shared" are scoped to the user who submits the question.
So an individual user will only see their own chats and their own history.
