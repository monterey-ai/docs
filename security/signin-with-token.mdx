Some email providers and security tools can disrupt the normal email-sign in flow supported in Monterey AI, as the link sent to the provided address is mis-handled and ends up incorrect once clicked.

To get around this, you can reach out to [support@monterey.ai](mailto:support@monterey.ai) to request having token sign in enabled for your team.

Once it is enabled, the process you will follow to sign in is described below:

<Steps>
  <Steps title="Navigate to the Sign In page">
    Here is a direct link:
    [https://app.monterey.ai/auth/signin](https://app.monterey.ai/auth/signin)
  </Steps>
  <Steps title="Enter your email address" />
  <Steps title="Leave the page open after submitting your email address">
    You will receive an email with a token to sign in and you will return to
    this page to enter the token.
  </Steps>
  <Steps title="Go to your email and find the email from Monterey AI">
    Do not click the "Sign in" button in the email!
  </Steps>
  <Steps title="Copy the token from the bottom of the email">
    It will be a long string of random characters.
  </Steps>
  <Steps title="Return to the page left open on Monterey AI" />
  <Steps title="Paste the token into the field" />
  <Steps title="Click the 'Sign in' button" />
  <Steps title="You will be signed in and redirected to the app!" />
</Steps>
